Chapter 3 Abstraction mechanisms
This chapter presents ways of defining and using new types including the basic properties, 
implementation techniques, and language facilities used for concrete classes, abstract classes, 
and class hierarchies. 

Concrete classes
Abstract classes
Class Hierarchies 

templates are introduced as a way to parameterize different types and algorithms together. 

Concrete Classes - the representation is part of the definition 
Concrete types behave just like built in types but with their own semantics as well. 

member functions that require access to the representation must be defined in the class
functions that do not require access to the private representation can be defined outside the class
member functions defined IN the class are automatically inlined

A struct is simply a class where the members are public by default.

Structs are kind of cool because defining one seems to also define a sort of default constructor. So depending on how the struct is layed out you can just declare one with 
the appropirate inputs in the appropirate order and it just build it for you without defining an explicit constructor. 
It's sort of like an implied constructor. 

Actually it's not. A struct is layed out in memory in a particular order and when you use brace initialization you're basically just giving what it expects layed out the same 
way, so it just sticks it where it goes and calls it good.
